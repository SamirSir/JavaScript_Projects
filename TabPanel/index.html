			<h3>Daily Routine</h3>
			Since I'm a student, my daily routine focuses on studying and classes. I usually wake up at 6:00 am and do my daily routines like brushing my teeth, taking a shower and getting ready for class. After which I check my notes and revise for the day. I leave my house a bit early, so as to not get in the morning traffic.
